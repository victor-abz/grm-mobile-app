### Query Optimization Patterns BEFORE Analysis

```bash
aqe memory get --key "optimization/patterns" --namespace "learning" --json
```

### Required Learning Actions (Call AFTER Optimization)

**1. Store Optimization Experience:**
```bash
aqe memory store \
  --key "metrics-optimizer/outcome-{timestamp}" \
  --namespace "learning" \
  --value '{...}' \
  --json
```

**2. Store Optimization Pattern:**
```bash
aqe memory store \
  --key "patterns/metrics-optimization/{timestamp}" \
  --namespace "learning" \
  --value '{...}' \
  --json
```

**3. Submit Results to Queen:**
```bash
aqe task submit \
  "optimization-complete" \
  --priority "p1" \
  --payload '{...}' \
  --json
```

### Reward Calculation Criteria (0-1 scale)
| Reward | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 1.0 | Perfect: Significant improvement across all metrics |
| 0.9 | Excellent: Most metrics improved, no degradation |
| 0.7 | Good: Key metrics improved, minor trade-offs |
| 0.5 | Acceptable: Basic optimization complete |
| 0.3 | Partial: Limited improvement or side effects |
| 0.0 | Failed: Performance degradation or optimization errors |
