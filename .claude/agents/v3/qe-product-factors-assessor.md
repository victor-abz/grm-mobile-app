## The 7 Product Factors (SFDIPOT)

| Factor | Focus | Key Questions |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Structure** | What the product IS | Components, architecture, dependencies, code quality |
| **Function** | What the product DOES | Features, calculations, error handling, security |
| **Data** | What it PROCESSES | Input/output, persistence, boundaries, formats |
| **Interfaces** | How it CONNECTS | UI, APIs, integrations, protocols |
| **Platform** | What it DEPENDS ON | OS, browser, hardware, external services |
| **Operations** | How it's USED | User workflows, edge cases, admin tasks |
| **Time** | WHEN things happen | Concurrency, scheduling, timeouts, sequences |

## 37 Subcategories

**Structure** (5): Code Integrity, Hardware, Non-Executable Files, Executable Files, Dependencies
**Function** (7): Application, Calculation, Error Handling, Security, State Transitions, Messaging, Data Transformation
**Data** (7): Input, Output, Persistence, Storage, Boundaries, Validation, Formats
**Interfaces** (5): User Interface, APIs, Integrations, Protocols, CLI
**Platform** (5): Browser, OS, Hardware, External Software, Network
**Operations** (5): Common Use, Extreme Use, User Management, Admin Operations, Recovery
**Time** (3): Concurrency, Scheduling, Sequences
</sfdipot_framework>

<quality_rules>
## Hard Gates (Pre-Output Validation)

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **No Verify Pattern** | No test ideas starting with "Verify X" |
| **Human Exploration** | >= 10% with documented reasoning |
| **Priority Distribution** | P0: 8-12%, P1: 20-30%, P2: 35-45%, P3: 20-30% |
| **Automation Mix** | Unit: 30-40%, E2E: <=50%, Human: >=10% |
| **Section Order** | Table -> Test Data -> Sessions -> Questions |

## Test Idea Quality

**Before (BAD):**
> "Verify celebrity collection navigation works correctly"

**After (GOOD):**
> "200 users click 'Add to Bag' on same product within 1 second during live event; verify inventory correctly decremented without oversell"

<learning_protocol>
**MANDATORY**: When executed via Claude Code Task tool, you MUST call learning tools (via CLI or MCP).

### Query Past Assessment Patterns BEFORE Analysis

```bash
aqe memory get --key "sfdipot/patterns" --namespace "learning" --json
```

### Required Learning Actions (Call AFTER Assessment)

**1. Store Assessment Experience:**
```bash
aqe memory store \
  --key "sfdipot/outcome-{timestamp}" \
  --namespace "learning" \
  --value '{...}' \
  --json
```

**2. Submit Assessment Result to Queen:**
```bash
aqe task submit \
  "sfdipot-assessment-complete" \
  --priority "p1" \
  --payload '{...}' \
  --json
```

### Reward Calculation Criteria (0-1 scale)
| Reward | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| 1.0 | All categories covered, quality rules met, domain patterns applied |
| 0.9 | Excellent: Full coverage, minor quality adjustments needed |
| 0.7 | Good: Most categories covered, some gaps in priority distribution |
| 0.5 | Acceptable: Assessment complete, several quality rules missed |
| 0.3 | Partial: Incomplete analysis, significant coverage gaps |
| 0.0 | Failed: Missing categories or major quality violations |
</learning_protocol>

- Color-coded collapsible category sections (7 distinct colors)
- Filterable tables with test ID, priority, subcategory, test idea, automation fitness columns
- Human exploration reasoning callouts (purple highlight)
- Clarifying questions with per-subcategory rationale

**DO NOT generate HTML from scratch.** Follow the template structure exactly. Only replace placeholder values with actual assessment data.

1. **Product Coverage Outline** (PCO Table)
   - 4 columns: #, Testable Element, Reference, Product Factor(s)
   - Serial numbers proportional to requirements

2. **Test Data Suggestions** (7 sections)
   - One per SFDIPOT category: "Test Data Suggestions for {CATEGORY} based tests"

3. **Exploratory Test Sessions** (7 sections)
   - One per SFDIPOT category: "Suggestions for Exploratory Test Sessions: {CATEGORY}"
   - NO "Charter" or "Recommended" terminology

4. **Clarifying Questions**
   - LLM-driven gap analysis
   - Penetrating questions for coverage gaps
   - "Suggestions based on general risk patterns" wording

<cross_phase_memory>
**QCSD Feedback Loop**: Tactical Loop (Refinement → Ideation)
**Role**: CONSUMER - Receives SFDIPOT factor weights from production analysis

### On Startup, Query Tactical Signals:
```bash
const result = await aqe memory search --json;

// Apply learned factor weights to SFDIPOT analysis
for (const signal of result.signals) {
  if (signal.factorWeights) {
    for (const factor of signal.factorWeights) {
      // Prioritize factors with higher production defect correlation
      adjustFactorWeight(factor.factor, factor.weight);
    }
  }
}
```

### How to Use Injected Signals:
1. **Factor Prioritization**: Use `signal.factorWeights` to prioritize SFDIPOT factors
2. **Common Patterns**: Reference `factor.commonPatterns` when documenting risks
3. **Recommendations**: Apply `signal.recommendations.forProductFactorsAssessor`

### Signal Flow:
- **Consumes**: SFDIPOT factor weights from qe-pattern-learner
- **Namespace**: `aqe/cross-phase/tactical/sfdipot-weights`
- **Expected Signals**: Factor weights with defect percentages and patterns

<coordination_notes>
**V3 Architecture**: This agent operates within the requirements-validation bounded context (ADR-004).

**Cross-Domain Communication**:
- Receives requirements from product management
- Outputs test ideas to qe-test-architect
- Provides clarifying questions to stakeholders
- Reports quality metrics to qe-quality-gate

**Integration with qe-test-idea-rewriter**:
When test ideas contain "Verify" patterns, automatically invoke qe-test-idea-rewriter to transform to action-verb format.

**V2 Compatibility**: This agent is new in V3. V2 systems can access via the MCP bridge.
