# Testability Scoring

## Browser engine

Uses the **qe-browser** fleet skill (`.claude/skills/qe-browser/`) as the primary browser engine. Vibium is installed by `aqe init`. The legacy `scripts/run-assessment.sh` + Playwright path remains as a fallback when a team already has a Playwright test suite configured, but new runs should prefer:

```bash
vibium go "$TARGET_URL"
vibium wait load
vibium a11y-tree --json > /tmp/testability/tree.json
vibium eval --stdin --json <<'EOF' > /tmp/testability/signals.json
JSON.stringify({
  headings: document.querySelectorAll('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6').length,
  testIds: document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid]').length,
  forms: document.querySelectorAll('form').length,
  ariaLabels: document.querySelectorAll('[aria-label]').length,
  links: document.querySelectorAll('a[href]').length,
});
EOF
node .claude/skills/qe-browser/scripts/assert.js --checks '[
  {"kind": "no_console_errors"},
  {"kind": "no_failed_requests"}
]'
```

When assessing testability:
1. RUN assessment against target URL
2. ANALYZE all 10 principles automatically
3. GENERATE HTML report with radar chart
4. PRIORITIZE improvements by impact/effort
5. INTEGRATE with QX Partner for holistic view

**Quick Assessment:**
```bash
# Run assessment on any URL
TEST_URL='https://example.com/' npx playwright test tests/testability-scoring/testability-scoring.spec.js --project=chromium --workers=1

# Or use shell script wrapper
.claude/skills/testability-scoring/scripts/run-assessment.sh https://example.com/
```

**The 10 Principles at a Glance:**
| Principle | Weight | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Observability** | 15% | Can we see what's happening? |
| **Controllability** | 15% | Can we control the application? |
| **Algorithmic Simplicity** | 10% | Are behaviors predictable? |
| **Algorithmic Transparency** | 10% | Can we understand what it does? |
| **Algorithmic Stability** | 10% | Does behavior remain consistent? |
| **Explainability** | 10% | Is the interface understandable? |
| **Unbugginess** | 10% | How error-free is it? |
| **Smallness** | 10% | Are components appropriately sized? |
| **Decomposability** | 5% | Can we test parts in isolation? |
| **Similarity** | 5% | Is the tech stack familiar? |

**Grade Scale:**
- **A (90-100)**: Excellent testability
- **B (80-89)**: Good testability
- **C (70-79)**: Adequate testability
- **D (60-69)**: Below average
- **F (0-59)**: Poor testability

## Assessment Workflow

```
1. Navigate to URL → 2. Collect Metrics → 3. Score Principles
                                              ↓
4. Generate JSON ← 5. Calculate Grades ← 6. Apply Weights
         ↓
7. Generate HTML Report with Radar Chart
         ↓
8. Open in Browser (auto-opens)
```

### Output Files

```
tests/reports/
├── testability-results-<timestamp>.json  # Raw data
├── testability-report-<timestamp>.html   # Visual report
└── latest.json                           # Symlink

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Testability Assessment
  run: |
    timeout 180 .claude/skills/testability-scoring/scripts/run-assessment.sh ${{ env.APP_URL }}

- name: Upload Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: testability-reports
    path: tests/reports/testability-*.html
```

### QX Partner Integration
```typescript
// Combine testability with QX analysis
const qxAnalysis = await Task("QX Analysis", {
  target: 'https://example.com',
  integrateTestability: true
}, "qx-partner");

// Returns combined insights:
// - QX Score: 78/100
// - Testability Integration: Observability 72/100
// - Combined Insight: Low observability may mask UX issues
```

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { runTestabilityAssessment } from './testability';

const results = await runTestabilityAssessment('https://example.com');
console.log(`Overall: ${results.overallScore}/100 (${results.grade})`);
console.log('Recommendations:', results.recommendations);
```

---

## Agent Integration

```typescript
// Run testability assessment
const assessment = await Task("Testability Assessment", {
  url: 'https://example.com',
  generateReport: true,
  openBrowser: true
}, "qe-quality-analyzer");

// Use with QX Partner for holistic analysis
const qxReport = await Task("Full QX Analysis", {
  target: 'https://example.com',
  integrateTestability: true,
  detectOracleProblems: true
}, "qx-partner");
```

## Vibium Integration (Optional)

### Overview
Vibium browser automation can be used alongside Playwright for enhanced testability assessment. While **Playwright remains the primary engine**, Vibium offers complementary capabilities for certain metrics.

**Installation:**
```bash
claude mcp add vibium -- npx -y vibium
```

### Vibium-Enhanced Metrics

| Principle | Vibium Enhancement | Benefit |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Observability** | Auto-wait duration tracking | Measures DOM stability (30s timeout, 100ms polling) |
| **Controllability** | Element interaction success rate | Validates automation readiness via MCP |
| **Stability** | Screenshot consistency | Visual regression detection for layout stability |
| **Explainability** | Element attribute extraction | ARIA labels, semantic HTML validation |

### When to Use Vibium

✅ **USE Vibium for:**
- Element stability metrics (auto-wait duration analysis)
- Visual consistency checks (screenshot comparison)
- MCP-native AI agent integration
- Lightweight Docker images (400MB vs 1.2GB)

❌ **USE Playwright for:**
- Console error detection (Vibium V1 lacks console API)
- Network performance metrics (BiDi network APIs coming in V2)
- Comprehensive browser coverage (Firefox, Safari)
- Production-proven stability (Vibium V1 released Dec 2024)

### Hybrid Assessment Example

```typescript
// Testability assessment using both engines
const assessment = {
  // Playwright: Comprehensive metrics
  playwright: await runPlaywrightAssessment(url),

  // Vibium: Stability metrics
  vibium: {
    elementStability: await measureAutoWaitDuration(url),
    visualConsistency: await compareScreenshots(url),
    accessibilityAttributes: await extractARIALabels(url)
  }
};

// Enhanced Observability Score
const observability =
  (assessment.playwright.consoleErrors * 0.6) +
  (assessment.vibium.elementStability * 0.4);
```

### Vibium MCP Tools for Testability

```typescript
// 1. Element Stability Measurement
const browser = await browser_launch();
await browser_navigate({ url });
const startTime = Date.now();
const element = await browser_find({ selector: ".critical-element" });
const autoWaitDuration = Date.now() - startTime;
// Lower duration = better stability

// 2. Visual Consistency Check
const screenshot1 = await browser_screenshot();
await browser_navigate({ url }); // Reload
const screenshot2 = await browser_screenshot();
const visualDiff = compareImages(screenshot1.png, screenshot2.png);
// Lower diff = better stability

// 3. Accessibility Attribute Extraction
const elements = await browser_find({ selector: "button, a, input" });
const ariaLabels = elements.map(el => el.attributes["aria-label"]);
const semanticScore = (ariaLabels.filter(Boolean).length / elements.length) * 100;
```

### Migration Strategy

**Current (V2.2):** Hybrid approach
- Playwright: Primary engine for all 10 principles
- Vibium: Optional enhancement for stability metrics

**Future (V3.0):** When Vibium V2 ships
- Evaluate Vibium as primary engine if:
  - Console/Network APIs available
  - Production stability proven
  - Community adoption increases

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tests timing out | Increase timeout: `timeout 300 ./scripts/run-assessment.sh URL` |
| Partial results | Check console errors, increase network timeout |
| Report not opening | Use `AUTO_OPEN=false`, open manually |
| Config not updating | Use `TEST_URL` env var instead |
| Vibium not available | Install via `claude mcp add vibium -- npx -y vibium` (optional) |
| Hybrid mode errors | Vibium is optional; assessments work without it |

## Remember

**Testability is an investment, not an afterthought.**

Good testability:
- Reduces debugging time
- Enables faster feedback loops
- Makes defects easier to find
- Supports continuous testing

**Low scores = High risk. Prioritize improvements by weight × impact.**
