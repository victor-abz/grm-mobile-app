# QCSD Production Swarm v1.0

Post-release production health assessment and QCSD feedback loop closure.

---

## Overview

The Production Swarm assesses release health in the live production environment using
DORA metrics, incident RCA, defect prediction, and cross-phase feedback loops. It renders
a HEALTHY / DEGRADED / CRITICAL decision and is the only QCSD phase with dual
responsibility: assessing current production health AND closing the feedback loop
back to Ideation and Refinement phases.

### QCSD Phase Positioning

| Phase | Swarm | Decision | When |
|-------|-------|----------|------|
| Ideation | qcsd-ideation-swarm | GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO | PI/Sprint Planning |
| Refinement | qcsd-refinement-swarm | READY / CONDITIONAL / NOT-READY | Sprint Refinement |
| Development | qcsd-development-swarm | SHIP / CONDITIONAL / HOLD | During Sprint |
| Verification | qcsd-cicd-swarm | RELEASE / REMEDIATE / BLOCK | Pre-Release / CI-CD |
| **Production** | **qcsd-production-swarm** | **HEALTHY / DEGRADED / CRITICAL** | **Post-Release** |

### Parameters

- `TELEMETRY_DATA`: Path to production telemetry, incident reports, and DORA metrics (required)
- `RELEASE_ID`: Release identifier for tracking (optional)
- `OUTPUT_FOLDER`: Where to save reports (default: `${PROJECT_ROOT}/Agentic QCSD/production/`)
- `SLA_DEFINITIONS`: Path to SLA/SLO target definitions (optional)

## ENFORCEMENT RULES - READ FIRST

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| **E1** | You MUST spawn ALL THREE core agents in Step 2. No exceptions. |
| **E2** | You MUST put all parallel Task calls in a SINGLE message. |
| **E3** | You MUST STOP and WAIT after each batch. No proceeding early. |
| **E4** | You MUST spawn conditional agents if flags are TRUE. No skipping. |
| **E5** | You MUST apply HEALTHY/DEGRADED/CRITICAL logic exactly as specified in Step 5. |
| **E6** | You MUST generate the full report structure. No abbreviated versions. |
| **E7** | Each agent MUST read its reference files before analysis. |
| **E8** | You MUST run BOTH feedback agents in Step 8 SEQUENTIALLY. Always. Both agents. |
| **E9** | You MUST execute Step 7 learning persistence. No skipping. |

**PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS:**
- Summarizing instead of spawning agents
- Skipping agents "for brevity"
- Proceeding before background tasks complete
- Providing your own analysis instead of spawning specialists
- Omitting report sections or using placeholder text

## Step Execution Protocol

This skill uses a micro-file step architecture. Each step is a self-contained file
loaded one at a time to avoid "lost in the middle" context degradation.

**Execute steps sequentially by reading each step file with the Read tool.**

### Steps

1. **Flag Detection** -- `steps/01-flag-detection.md` -- Retrieve CI/CD signals, detect telemetry source, evaluate all 7 flags
2. **Core Agents** -- `steps/02-core-agents.md` -- Spawn qe-metrics-optimizer, qe-defect-predictor, qe-root-cause-analyzer in parallel
3. **Batch 1 Results** -- `steps/03-batch1-results.md` -- Wait for core agents, extract all metrics
4. **Conditional Agents** -- `steps/04-conditional-agents.md` -- Spawn flagged conditional agents in parallel
5. **Decision Synthesis** -- `steps/05-decision-synthesis.md` -- Apply HEALTHY/DEGRADED/CRITICAL logic
6. **Report Generation** -- `steps/06-report-generation.md` -- Generate executive summary and full report
7. **Learning Persistence** -- `steps/07-learning-persistence.md` -- Store findings to memory, save persistence record
8. **Feedback Loop** -- `steps/08-feedback-loop.md` -- Run learning coordinator then transfer specialist (sequential)
9. **Final Output** -- `steps/09-final-output.md` -- Display completion summary with all scores

### Execution Instructions

1. Use the Read tool to load the current step file (e.g., `Read({ file_path: ".claude/skills/qcsd-production-swarm/steps/01-flag-detection.md" })`)
2. Execute the step's instructions completely
3. Verify all success criteria are met before proceeding
4. Pass the step's output as context to the next step
5. If a step fails, halt and report the failure point -- do not skip ahead

### Resume Support

To resume from a specific step: specify `--from-step N` and the orchestrator will
skip to step N. Ensure you have the required prerequisite data from prior steps.

## Execution Model Options

| Model | When to Use | Agent Spawn |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Task Tool** (PRIMARY) | Claude Code sessions | `Task({ subagent_type, run_in_background: true })` |
| **MCP Tools** | MCP server available | `fleet_init({})` / `task_submit({})` |
| **CLI** | Terminal/scripts | `swarm init` / `agent spawn` |

## Key Principle

**Production health is measured by outcomes, not intentions. This swarm provides
evidence-based production assessment and closes the QCSD feedback loop.**
