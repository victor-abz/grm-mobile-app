# Defect Intelligence Domain Shard

**Domain**: defect-intelligence
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03
**Parent Constitution**: `.claude/guidance/constitution.md`

---

## Domain Rules

1. **ML Model Transparency**: Defect predictions MUST include confidence scores and feature importance explanations; black-box predictions without explainability are prohibited.

2. **Historical Data Requirement**: Defect prediction models MUST be trained on at least 30 days of historical defect data before being used for production predictions.

3. **Root Cause Verification**: Root cause analyses MUST be validated against actual fix data when available, with feedback loops to improve accuracy.

4. **Pattern Learning Discipline**: Defect patterns MUST only be learned from confirmed defects (not suspected or predicted), with FlashAttention optimization where available.

5. **Regression Risk Honesty**: Regression risk assessments MUST clearly distinguish between measured risk (from data) and estimated risk (from heuristics).

6. **Cluster Quality**: Defect clustering MUST achieve minimum silhouette score for valid cluster formation; invalid clusters MUST NOT be reported as patterns.

## Quality Thresholds

| Metric | Minimum | Target | Critical |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Prediction Accuracy | 0.7 | 0.85 | < 0.5 |
| Confidence | 0.6 | 0.8 | < 0.4 |
| Root Cause Accuracy | 0.6 | 0.8 | < 0.4 |
| Pattern Match Rate | 0.5 | 0.7 | < 0.3 |
| Cluster Silhouette Score | 0.3 | 0.5 | < 0.2 |
| Model Freshness | < 7 days | < 3 days | > 14 days |

## Patterns

**Domain Source**: `src/domains/defect-intelligence/`

| Pattern | Location | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Defect Predictor Service | `services/defect-predictor.ts` | ML-based prediction |
| Pattern Learner Service | `services/pattern-learner.ts` | Defect pattern extraction |
| Root Cause Analyzer Service | `services/root-cause-analyzer.ts` | RCA algorithms |
| Defect Intelligence Coordinator | `coordinator.ts` | Workflow orchestration |

**Key Interfaces**: `interfaces/index.ts` defines `PredictionResult`, `RootCauseAnalysis`, `DefectCluster`, and related types.

---

## Agent Constraints

| Role | Agent ID | Permissions |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | `qe-defect-predictor` | Full prediction, model training |
| **Secondary** | `qe-root-cause-analyzer` | RCA execution, pattern extraction |
| **Support** | `qe-pattern-learner` | Pattern learning from confirmed defects |
| **Readonly** | `qe-quality-gate` | Query predictions |

**Forbidden Agents**: Agents MUST NOT modify prediction models without retraining validation.

## Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Prediction accuracy < 0.5 | CRITICAL | Escalate to Queen Coordinator, retrain model |
| Model stale > 14 days | CRITICAL | Force model refresh, escalate |
| Root cause accuracy < 0.4 | HIGH | Escalate, request manual validation |
| Cluster silhouette < 0.2 | HIGH | Invalidate clusters, recalibrate |
| FlashAttention unavailable | MEDIUM | Fall back to standard attention, log |
| Unconfirmed defect used for learning | HIGH | Revert pattern, escalate |
| Feature importance missing | MEDIUM | Block prediction, request explanation |

---

## Memory Namespace

- **Namespace**: `qe-patterns/defect-intelligence`
- **Retention**: 90 days (longer for validated patterns)
- **Contradiction Check**: Enabled
